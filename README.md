# Brain Tumor Classification
This is an end-to-end deep learning project for predicting brain tumors from MRI scans, adhering to MLOps best practices. It involves data collection and preprocessing with TensorFlow datasets, model training with TensorFlow, model serving using TensorFlow Serving in a Docker image, and deployment through a FastAPI endpoint with a ReactJS front-end for user interaction, as shown in the architecture diagram below.
